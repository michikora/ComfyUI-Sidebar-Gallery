"""ComfyUI node-signature registry, structural classification, and the
pure-value link resolver.

Node roles come from ComfyUI's own knowledge of every installed node (input
names and types, output names and types, category) instead of name patterns.

- NodeRegistry: live mode reads ComfyUI's NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS in-process;
  snapshot mode loads an /object_info-shaped JSON snapshot so everything
  works without a live ComfyUI. Unknown classes
  return None and callers fall back to the legacy name heuristics.

- classify(): structural role of a node (sampler / text_encode / loader /
  lora / image_resize / latent_resize / interpolation / display / switch /
  zero_conditioning) derived from its I/O types instead of its name.

- resolve_link(): follow a [node_id, slot] reference to a concrete value.
  A value is only trusted if its producer is a PURE VALUE node, meaning all
  of its own connected inputs are scalars (recursively). Output slots are
  matched by their declared names (GetImageSize width/height, mxSlider2D X/Y,
  JPS width/height from a "WxH" combo string). Runtime-measured values (an
  IMAGE-fed producer) always yield UNRESOLVED rather than an unrelated
  upstream literal.
